# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Functions
        A Function is when you create a block of code that you can reuse as needed.  It's kind of like a shortcut.  For example, in sports plays, you wouldn't want to have to say each time which player is going to where on the field so each play has a name.  When the quarterback calls a "blue 52", every member of the team knows where they are supposed to go and what their task is without it having to be spelled out each time.
	* Parameters
        A parameter is like a placeholder in a function.  It allows you to write a function that is reusable.  For our sports example, a parameter might be the quarterback throwing the ball to a receiver, but without naming the receiver specifically.  This means the same play could be reused as needed without having to recreate it all over again for each receiver.
	* Arguments
        Arguments are the parameters that are "named."  In our sports example, the quarterback might have a play that says throw to x receiver.  During the game the QB might specify that x receiver is going to be Smith.  x is the parameter and Smith would be the argument.
	* `if` statements
        If statements are like cause and effect.  If you don't do your homework, then you will not make a good grade.  If the program comes up with the requested answer, then it will give a certain response.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.


4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
